# GCP Network Architecture Diagram

The provided diagram illustrates a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) network architecture. Here is a detailed description:

1. **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**:
   - The architecture is based on a VPC with the IP range `10.0.0.0/16`.

2. **Regions and Subnets**:
   - **Region: us-west1**
     - **Subnet 1**: 
       - IP range: `10.240.0.0/24`
       - Contains a zone: `us-west1-a`
       - This zone has two Virtual Machines (VMs).

   - **Region: us-east1**
     - **Subnet 2**: 
       - IP range: `192.168.1.0/24`
       - Contains a zone: `us-east1-a`
       - This zone has two VMs.
     - **Subnet 3**: 
       - IP range: `10.2.0.0/16`
       - Contains two zones: `us-east1-a` and `us-east1-b`
       - Each of these zones has one VM.

3. **VPC Routing**:
   - A VPC routing component is shown, which connects to the cloud and manages the traffic between the different subnets and regions within the VPC.

This architecture demonstrates a multi-region and multi-zone setup within GCP, using VPC routing to manage internal communications between different subnets and zones. The VPC routing ensures that all the VMs in different subnets and zones can communicate with each other efficiently.
